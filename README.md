# Safran Reseach Internship 2022 Coding Problem1

This problem is an optional take home problem as part of the Safran Landing System Research Internship interviews. The purpose of this problem is to give you the opportunity to showcase your abilities in calculus and optimization by writing your own simple optimizer for a given function. 

Templates are provided to complete this problem as an ipython notebook and alternatively as a matlab livescript. The ipython notebook has been tested and used in past interviews, the MatLab livescript has not.

## Problem
Write your own optimizer (prepackaged optimizers such as Scipy Minimize or MatLab fmincon are not considered solutions) to minimize the function `f(x) = 3(x-3)^4 +4ln(x)`. A prepackaged optimizer can be used to test your function.

The provided ipython notebook and MatLab livescript suggest the use of a Newton Solver to find the local minema, although you may use any approach you prefer.
